# Phase 3 Development Checkpoint

**Live, update-in-place record of Phase 3 engineering progress.** Read this
first when resuming Phase 3 work in a new session. Update it in place at
each shutdown checkpoint rather than creating a new dated file -- the
`Last updated` line and the slice ledger are the source of truth for
"what is actually committed," independent of any single conversation's
memory.

**Last updated:** 2026-10-11 (shutdown checkpoint after Slice G -- all
of Phase 3's implementation slices A-G are now complete; only the
Research Orchestrator, explicitly out of scope, remains unbuilt)

---

## Repository state (verified at last checkpoint)

- **Code repository:** `C:/github/backendtest`
- **Branch:** `feature/phase3-slice-c-cycle-intelligence` (stacked: this
  branch carries Slice A through Slice G commits in sequence; despite its
  name it is the current working branch for all of Phase 3, not only
  Slice C -- each slice branched from the previous slice's tip rather
  than from `master`)
- **HEAD:** `82a092b` -- "feat(phase3-slice-g): add Investment Case
  (nine-gate assessment) and InvestmentCaseService"
- **Working tree:** clean
- **GitHub:** fully integrated through PR #1, owner-approved and
  executed 2026-10-12. `gh` CLI authenticated (device-flow browser
  auth, owner action; portable zip install after the MSI installer
  hung on a UAC prompt it could not get in a non-interactive session --
  killed, no admin rights used or required). PR #1's title/description
  were updated to reflect the full A-G stack, then merged into
  `feature/research-coverage-foundation` via an ordinary merge commit
  (`9ff53f2`) -- **not** squash, **not** rebase, so all seven individual
  Phase 3 commits remain intact and individually reachable, per the
  owner's explicit "preserve existing commit history" instruction.
  Verified independently via plain `git log`/`git merge-base`, not just
  the GitHub UI. The PR branch (`feature/phase3-slice-a-contracts`) was
  **not** deleted. `feature/research-coverage-foundation` -> `master`
  remains unmerged and has no PR of its own yet -- **explicitly not
  done**, per the owner's own instruction, pending separate approval.
- **Live database** (`instance/trading_app.db`): Alembic revision
  `20261007_05` -- **five migrations behind this branch's head
  (`20261008_05`)**. The live database has never been migrated during
  Phase 3 work; every migration (Slices A, C, D, G) has only ever been
  tested against isolated SQLite copies in a session scratchpad, built
  via `sqlite3.Connection.backup()`, never against the live file. Slices
  E/F added no migration (service-layer corrections + new wrapper
  services only, no schema change). Slice G's migration
  (`20261008_05`) was verified both ways on an isolated copy this
  session: `flask db upgrade` to head created exactly the five new
  tables and both partial-unique "single genesis" indexes; `flask db
  downgrade 20261008_04` cleanly dropped all five with nothing left
  behind. The live file's own revision was re-checked immediately
  before and after this session's work and is unchanged.
- **Design/planning repository:** `C:/github/stock-price-alert`,
  `docs/superpowers/plans/` -- holds the design proposal, the
  architecture-review addendum, and this checkpoint.

## Latest regression result

**1,474 passed, 0 failed** (full suite, `python -m pytest -q`, ~13.3
min, 2026-10-11, after Slice G). The one previously-recurring,
pre-existing flake named below passed cleanly this run too --
consistent with it being a true intermittent flake rather than anything
Slice G (or any Phase 3 code) touches.

`tests/documents/test_content_addressed_document_architecture.py::test_changing_storage_location_does_not_create_new_binary_identity`
-- a **known, recurring, pre-existing flake**, unrelated to any Phase 3
work (it asserts a global, unscoped `DocumentContent` row count; each
test gets a fully isolated fresh SQLite file per `tests/conftest.py`'s
`app` fixture, so there is no real cross-test leakage mechanism). It has
now recurred across three separate full-suite runs (after Slice D, after
Slice E not at all, after Slice F) and passed cleanly again after Slice
G. Diagnosed twice already; do not re-investigate without a new symptom.
Phase 3 code has never touched document/content-hash logic.

## Slice completion ledger

| Slice | Delivers | Commit | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | Contracts: `scenario`/`origin` columns + partial-unique-index pair on `forecast_revision`/`valuation_revision`; `FinancialMetricDefinition`; `FiscalPeriod` resolver | `30bb2a6` | Done |
| B | `financial_diagnostics_service.py`, `financial_narration_service.py`; `ADJUSTED` metric namespace; real Chemplast D5 pilot (reconciled COGS, CCVL impairment adjustment) | `0686d95` | Done |
| C | `CycleObservation`/`CycleAssessment`/`CompanyExposure`; `CycleIntelligenceService`; DB-enforced revision-chain integrity (no branching, single genesis, race-safe); real Chemplast PVC/VCM-spread `CycleAssessment` + `CompanyExposure` | `cbfb6b8` | Done |
| D | `InvestmentHypothesis`/`InvestmentHypothesisCitation`/`ForecastAssumption`; `HypothesisAssumptionService`; P3-D atomicity rule (one row = one driver = one provenance source); real Chemplast hypothesis citing real Slice B/C output | `54eb7fd` | Done |
| E | Scenario-aware `create_forecast_revision` (fixed two latent gaps: scenario never wired into the values-builder/current-lookup, and the race-detector still checked the pre-Slice-A constraint name); `ForecastRevisionAssumption`; `ForecastEngineService` | `aa4a0ef` | Done |
| F | Same scenario-aware correction applied to `create_valuation_revision` (same two gaps, same fix); `ValuationEngineService` deriving `reference_metric_value` directly from cited `ForecastLine`s, never caller-asserted | `d9ca4e0` | Done |
| G | `InvestmentCase`, `InvestmentCaseForecast`/`InvestmentCaseValuation` link tables, `InvestmentCaseKillSwitch`, `InvestmentCaseGateResult` (nine gates), `InvestmentCaseService.get_scenario_return_spread` | `82a092b` | **Done** |
| Orchestrator | Contract only (§6 of the design proposal) | -- | Not implemented; not authorized under any circumstance without separate approval |

**Phase 3's implementation scope (Slices A-G) is now complete.** The
only named, specified-but-intentionally-unbuilt piece of the approved
design proposal is the Research Orchestrator (§6) -- a future trigger/
consumer mechanism that requires separate, explicit owner approval
before any implementation, exactly as it did at every prior checkpoint.

## Outstanding acceptance item (carried forward, not an engine defect)

**The real-Chemplast four-scenario forecast and valuation demonstration
remains unresolved.** The real BULL-scenario `ForecastAssumption` rows
from the Slice D pilot (citing a real `CompanyExposure`/`CycleAssessment`
and a real `ResearchProposition`, both grounded in verbatim Q4 FY26
earnings-call commentary) carry a real `metric_slug` but no
`assumed_value` was ever recorded. `ForecastEngineService` and
`ValuationEngineService` both correctly refuse to fabricate a number in
its absence -- confirmed by running the real attempt against an isolated
database copy and observing the explicit "cannot be computed without
fabricating a figure" rejection, not a silent or invented result. No real
numeric Chemplast `ForecastRevision` or `ValuationRevision` exists yet.
Resolving this requires either additional real, evidence-grounded
numeric assumptions (a deliberate analyst judgment call, explicitly
justified and attributed, not a verbatim-quoted figure) or recording it
as a standing limitation of the current real-document evidence base.
This was independent of Slice G and did not block it -- confirmed again
at the Slice G boundary: Slice G's own full-chain mechanism was proven
end to end against disposable fixtures (nine gates, a kill switch, and
a live, non-fabricated Bull/Base/Bear return spread), the same
substitution every non-acceptance engine test in this codebase already
uses, with no real-Chemplast numeric trace attempted. This gap remains
open and un-widened by Slice G.

## Engineering-autonomy permissions and standing constraints (preserved)

- Engineering autonomy over implementation details, schema design within
  an approved scope, code organization, testing, ordinary corrective
  changes, and committing -- granted per-slice throughout this
  engagement and intended to continue under the same terms for Slice G.
- **Never** modify or migrate the live database without a separate,
  explicit authorization; all migration testing happens only against
  isolated SQLite copies in the session scratchpad.
- **Never** create a parallel/duplicate architecture, a second ingestion
  or extraction pathway, or bypass an existing tested mechanism -- every
  slice so far has been a thin, additive extension of prior slices'
  infrastructure (Slice C reused Slice 4's `ResearchProposition`
  mechanism unchanged for Transformation; Slice D reused all five of its
  provenance targets as-is; Slices E/F are corrections to, and thin
  wrappers around, the pre-existing M1 revision-chain code, never a
  second forecast/valuation mechanism).
- Do not fabricate reported Facts or calculated forecasts/valuations.
  Explicit, justified analyst-authored numerical assumptions are
  permitted and must be clearly distinguished from both reported Facts
  and from calculated results derived from them.
- No new frameworks, no AI/LLM dependency in any diagnostics/narration/
  engine service (verified by dedicated import-boundary tests in Slice
  B; the same discipline has been maintained, not re-tested per slice,
  in every slice since).

## GitHub integration state (as of this checkpoint)

- PR #1 (`feature/phase3-slice-a-contracts` -> `feature/research-
  coverage-foundation`) is open, unmerged, and now contains all seven
  Phase 3 commits (A-G) after this session's fast-forward push -- see
  "Repository state" above. Nothing was force-pushed and no history was
  rewritten anywhere in this stack.
- Two merge decisions remain genuinely outstanding and were deliberately
  left to the owner, not actioned automatically: (1) merging PR #1 into
  `feature/research-coverage-foundation`, and (2) merging `feature/
  research-coverage-foundation` into `master` (which has no PR of its
  own yet -- confirmed by listing every PR on the repo, open or closed;
  PR #1 is the only one that has ever existed). Either merge is a
  shared-state, human-governed-promotion-style decision this engagement
  has consistently reserved for the owner, the same way `SYSTEM_DRAFT`
  rows are never self-promoting.
- The PR's title/body text is stale (still reads "Slice A contracts ...
  no Slices B-G") because updating it requires a GitHub API write token
  this session did not have; only `git push` over the existing
  credential-manager-backed HTTPS remote succeeded. Refresh it from this
  checkpoint (or from each slice's own commit message) before merging.

## Resume instructions for the next session

**Phase 3's implementation scope (Slices A-G) is complete.** There is no
pending Phase 3 implementation work to resume -- only the two owner-level
merge decisions above, and the Orchestrator, which stays unbuilt until
separately approved. If a future session is asked to "continue Phase 3,"
read this checkpoint first and confirm there is genuinely new scope
before writing any code; do not re-open or re-implement any of Slices
A-G.

**Next major development priority: the Integrated Investment
Intelligence Alert System** (per owner direction, 2026-10-11) -- **now
scoped**, per owner request (2026-10-12), in
`2026-10-12-integrated-investment-intelligence-alert-system-design-proposal.md`
(this same `docs/superpowers/plans/` directory). That document: drops
the 2026-09-25 roadmap's stale "Business Pulse" anchor (never built) in
favor of Phase 3's real, already-shipped signal sources; places the
system as a cross-cutting notification layer outside the North-Star
hierarchy itself (§22), never asserting chain truth; proposes exactly
two new, purely-additive tables (`AlertEvent`/`AlertDelivery`); names
kill-switch triggers, gate `FAIL` results, and `InvestmentCase`
view-changing supersessions as the highest-signal v1 Investment Brain
sources, alongside absorbing the legacy `Trade`/Telegram pathway's
notification step (not its live-websocket triggering mechanism) into
the same durable, auditable plumbing; and lists six explicit open
questions for owner decision (provenance shape, recipient targeting,
delivery timing, its relationship to the still-unbuilt Research
Orchestrator, v1 event-source scope, and channel scope). **Do not start
writing alert-system code before that proposal's open questions are
resolved and the scope is explicitly approved** -- the same phase-gate
discipline every Phase 3 slice was held to.
